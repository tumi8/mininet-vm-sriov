# Analysis of Statistical Values per Experiment

In this folder there is the `anaysis-statistics.py` script to retrieve statistical values such as Jitter, average, maximum, and standard deviation.

To be able to run the script, the requirements.txt Python3 requirements need to be installed and then in the analysis-statistics.py script the path to the latency-flow.csv.zst file to analyze need to be set, one example is shown.

The corresponding CSVs used in the paper are available in [mediaTUM repository](https://doi.org/10.14459/2025mp1773238).
